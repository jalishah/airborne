## Sensors:

- CHR-6DM attitude and heading reference system: euler angles, accelerometers, gyro values
- Ublox LEA-4GPS: global GPS position
- ultrasonic range finder: max. 7 meters above the ground
- barometric pressure sensor: meters above sea level
- voltage sensor: voltage divider on VBat connected to ADC7
- RPM sensor: indicates motor RPM (read from brushless motor controllers)

## Actuators:

- interface to holger flight control in heading-hold (aka axis lock) mode
- signal light (xenon flash)
- audio output via espeak/mp3 player
